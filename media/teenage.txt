Hey teenagehood... Not everything has  the most sane answer but sometimes you just have to let go .Let it pass ..it might be the most painful phrase .Some people are meant to be just in our lives for a short period of time and we have to embrace it whether we like it and not .Remember not to torture yourself no one deserves that .Some people come to teach us  about life ina painful way but we have to learn the hard way .When we feel depressed and deprived of love ve then we must remember the things that makes us happy just to bring a smile to our face .Your smile can change someone''s life and remember you are loved  😍
